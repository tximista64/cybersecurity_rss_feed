<h2>What about</h2>

A simple and curated list of my favorite cybersecurity RSS/Atom feeds, organized by theme (Blue Team, Offensive, Web, CTF, Conferences, etc.).  
It helps me centralize all the sources I monitor in a terminal-friendly format (via `rss2email`, `newsboat`, etc.).

Most feeds are in **English**, but you'll also find a lot in **French** and some in **Spanish**, **Hebrew**, and **Farsi**.
