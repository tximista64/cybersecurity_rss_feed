# Cybersecurity monitoring RSS feeds

![image](https://github.com/tximista64/cybersecurity_rss_feed/blob/main/analyst.png)

## What is this?

A curated list of cybersecurity RSS/Atom feeds organized by theme, paired with `cyber_watch.py` — a script that pulls today's articles and pipes them to [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) to generate a structured daily threat intelligence digest, ready for Obsidian.

Feeds are grouped into sections:

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| **Blueteam** | DFIR, malware analysis, threat intel, CVEs |
| **Offensive** | Red team, exploit research, offensive tooling |
| **Bug Bounty / Web** | Bug bounty writeups, web security research |
| **Persons of Interest** | Individual researchers & practitioners |
| **Podcasts** | Cyber & geopolitics podcasts |
| **CTF** | Capture The Flag platforms & walkthroughs |
| **Conf** | Black Hat, DEF CON, CCC and more |
| **Osint & Geopo** | OSINT, geopolitics, strategic intelligence |

Most feeds are in **English**, but you'll also find many in **French**, and some in **Spanish**, **Hebrew**, and **German**.
