<h1>Cybersecurity monitoring rss feeds</h1>

<h2>What about</h2>

A simple and curated list of my favorite cybersecurity RSS/Atom feeds, organized by theme (Blue Team, Offensive, Web, CTF, Conferences, etc.).  
It helps me centralize all the sources I monitor in a terminal-friendly format using tools like `rss2email`, `newsboat`, or custom scripts.

Most feeds are in **English**, but you'll also find many in **French**, and some in **Spanish**, **Hebrew**, and **German**.

Feel free to share your favorite feeds by opening an issue or pull request â€” especially if you know great resources in Chinese, Farsi or Hebrew. Let's keep this list growing together!
